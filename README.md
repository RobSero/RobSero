## Heya guys! ##
### Welcome to my repo collection :) Theres a lot of scrappy projects lying about on here but some are good I hope. please have a look around and get in touch if you have any questions on them ###

I love building logic by flexing both my creative and technical mindsets on all sorts of side projects, working alongside other great developers who share the same determination and to celebrate the wins together (no matter how big or small).

I come from a deep background of technical problem solving (eight years) and commercial experience (two years) which I am excited to put to good use at my next role as a full time software engineer.

I aim to always take a fun yet disciplined approach to all my projects, respecting both the clientâ€™s specifications and the overall business model of the company. Striking a careful balance between the two I believe is crucial, but such a fun and rewarding experience.
